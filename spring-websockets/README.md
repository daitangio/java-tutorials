# Spring WebSockets

This module contains articles about Spring WebSockets.

## Introduction
Refer to the [Spring reference manual](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.x/reference/html/web.html#websocket) for an introduction.

This demo is based to Websocket + STOMP protocol.
The project enable a user to "connect" to a bi-directional socket and to receive asyncronous notification.
In this example the notification are time-based, and randomly select a user.

## Known issues: authentication 
We must relay on Token Authentication as described here
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.x/reference/html/web.html#websocket-stomp-authentication

Refer to the specific spring security integration for better implementations:
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/integrations/websocket.html#websocket-authorization


The current PoC is very simple and trut the client "login" header.
