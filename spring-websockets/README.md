# Spring WebSockets

This module contains articles about Spring WebSockets.

## Introduction
Refer to the [Spring reference manual](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.x/reference/html/web.html#websocket) for an introduction.

This demo is based to Websocket + STOMP protocol.
The project enable a user to "connect" to a bi-directional socket and to receive asyncronous notification.
In this example the notification are time-based, and randomly select a user.

## Known issues
At the time of writing we were unable to read the headers specifing the "login"+"pass" sent by STOMP.
It seems a design choice: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.x/reference/html/web.html#websocket-stomp-handle-broker-relay-configure
and we must relay on Token Authentication as described here
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.x/reference/html/web.html#websocket-stomp-authentication





## Scheduled WebSocket Push with Spring Boot

To test this open the bots.html with

# Changelog
Adapted to work on JDK 17, kept only one example called "sendtouser", extended and
